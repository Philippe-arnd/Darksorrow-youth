---

## Darksorrow (Protagonist)
- **Role:** Aspiring Rogue, undead resident of Glim.
- **Physical traits:** A skeletal frame held together by stubborn magic and fraying leather. His jaw tends to click when he's nervous. He wears a hood that's slightly too large, casting a permanent shadow over his glowing blue eye-sockets.
- **Personality:** Earnest, clumsy, and plagued by "imposter syndrome." He feels the weight of being "dead" more than others. He is prone to overthinking simple maneuvers.
- **Motivation:** To prove he belongs in the Rogue Academy and to bring honor to the small, forgotten village of Glim.

## Lamz (Rival)
- **Role:** Star pupil of the Academy.
- **Physical traits:** A sleek, high-tier undead (vampiric or well-preserved ghoul) with perfect posture and expensive obsidian daggers.
- **Personality:** Arrogant, effortless, and condescending. He views Darksorrow as a "reanimated mistake."
- **Motivation:** To graduate top of the class and secure a position in the High King’s Shadow-Guard.

## Rogue Master Crakoukass
- **Role:** Head Instructor of the Academy.
- **Physical traits:** A grizzled, ancient skeleton missing several ribs and sporting a jagged scar across his cranium. He moves with terrifying, silent speed.
- **Personality:** Brutally honest, demanding, and seemingly heartless. He speaks in rasps and metaphors.
- **Motivation:** To find the next "Shadow-Walker," believing that true talent is often hidden under layers of failure.
