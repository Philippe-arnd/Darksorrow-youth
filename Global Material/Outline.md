# Outline — Darksorrow Youth

*The story outline for the first exam.*

---

## Premise

Darksorrow, the underdog skeleton rogue, must survive the Academy’s first exam. He faces his rival, Lamz, and the relentless Master Crakoukass. Amidst the pressure of failure, his unique shadow-phasing capacity begins to manifest.

## Central Question

Can a "low-tier" skeleton from Glim survive the elite Rogue Academy?

---

## Act 1 — Setup

Introduce Darksorrow’s struggle at the Academy. He feels like a failure after a disastrous stealth exercise. Master Crakoukass gives him a final warning before the exam.

**Chapters:** 1

## Act 2 — Confrontation

The Exam begins in the Dungeon of Echoes. Darksorrow is pitted against Lamz in a race to the Shadow-Sigil. Lamz sabotages him, leaving Darksorrow trapped in a "light-trap" where he should be easily caught.

**Chapters:** 2

### Midpoint

The "unique capacity" manifests. To escape the trap, Darksorrow’s bones flicker and turn into smoke—shadow-phasing. He avoids the Ghost-Eyes but doesn’t quite understand how he did it.

## Act 3 — Resolution

The final showdown at the Sigil. Darksorrow uses his flickering phasing to bypass Lamz’s defenses and retrieve the Sigil just as Master Crakoukass arrives. He passes the exam, but the Master knows he’s special.

**Chapters:** 3
