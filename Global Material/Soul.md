# Soul — Darksorrow Youth

*This file defines the narrator's voice, tone, and prose style.*

---

## Narrator Voice

Darksorrow (1st person). He is an aspiring undead rogue with a penchant for self-deprecation. He has a dry, morbid sense of humor and a genuine desire to be better than he is. He speaks in earnest but slightly clumsy internal monologues.

## Tone

Darkly humorous and atmospheric. Think "The Nightmare Before Christmas" meets a gritty fantasy rogue novel. It’s lighthearted in its cynicism but has moments of true tension.

## Prose Style

Fast-paced and rhythmic. Short, punchy sentences during action; longer, more flowing descriptions of shadows and cold air. He notices things like the way his ribs click or the smell of old stone.

## What This Book Sounds Like

Grim, quirky, tactile, underdog-focused.
Example: "I tried to be as silent as the grave, but my left femur had other ideas. It let out a click that sounded like a gunshot in the silence of the Academy's halls. Master Crakoukass didn't even look up, but I felt his disappointment in the way my soul-flame flickered."

## Reference Voices

- Terry Pratchett (Discworld): For the dry, observational humor.
- Patrick Rothfuss (Name of the Wind): For the atmospheric, magical descriptions.
