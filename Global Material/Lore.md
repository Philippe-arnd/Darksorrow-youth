# Lore — Darksorrow Youth

*The worldbuilding reference for the world of Glim and the Rogue Academy.*

---

## Glim (Village)
A tiny, backwater undead village on the edge of the Deadlands. Known for its "low-tier" skeletons and ghouls. Most residents end up as field workers or guards, rarely as elites.

## The Rogue Academy
A brutal training ground where the finest undead are taught the arts of shadow, silence, and sudden death. Located in the Obsidian Citadel, it is presided over by Master Crakoukass.

## Undead Physiology
- **Low-tier (Skeletons):** Cheap, fragile, but tireless. They often lack the "shadow-affinity" needed for advanced rogue-craft.
- **Unique Capacity (Shadow-Phasing):** A legendary trait where an undead can temporarily turn their physical form into pure shadow. Darksorrow has this capacity but it only triggers under extreme stress or subconsciously.

## The Rogue’s Exam
The final trial for initiates. A lethal game of cat-and-mouse within the Academy’s "Dungeon of Echoes." To pass, one must retrieve a "Shadow-Sigil" from the center of the dungeon without being detected by the Master’s "Ghost-Eyes."
