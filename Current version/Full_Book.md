I tried to be as silent as the grave, but my left knee had other ideas. It let out a click that sounded like a dry branch snapping in the absolute silence of the Whispering Hall. I froze, my skeletal foot hovering an inch above the cold obsidian floor. 

*Don't breathe,* I thought, then remembered I hadn't breathed in three years. *Don't flicker.*

The blue soul-flames in my sockets pulsed with a nervous rhythm. I waited, counting the seconds by the steady thrum of the Citadel’s deep magic. The shadows in the Hall were thick, draped like heavy velvet over the stone pillars, and I was supposed to be part of them. But I wasn't. I was a collection of rattling bones in a hood that kept slipping over my eyes.

"Pathetic," a voice rasped from directly above me.

I didn't even see him move. Master Crakoukass didn't descend; he simply appeared, a jagged silhouette against the dim glow of the vaulted ceiling. He landed without a sound, his own ancient bones as silent as moonlight. He was a skeleton, like me, but where I felt like a pile of loose kindling, he looked like a weapon carved from ivory.

"Master Crakoukass," I stammered, my jaw clicking in sympathy with my knee. "I was... I was almost at the pillar."

"Almost is for the living, Darksorrow," he said, his voice a low grind of stone on stone. He leaned in, the faint scent of old parchment and graveyard dust clinging to his leather armor. "In the Obsidian Citadel, you are either a shadow or a corpse. And you are far too noisy to be a shadow."

I looked down at my hands. They were pale, thin, and currently trembling. "I'm trying, Master. It’s just... Glim isn't exactly a training ground for—"

"Glim is a hole for those who have forgotten how to hunt," Crakoukass interrupted. He straightened, his missing ribs casting long, barred shadows across the floor. "Tomorrow is the first exam. The Dungeon of Echoes. If you fail to retrieve the Sigil, you will not be given a second chance. I will personally escort you back to the Deadlands. You can spend the rest of eternity scavenging rust from the old farmsteads."

The thought hit me harder than a mace. Returning to Glim wasn't just a failure; it was a slow, dusty erasure. I wanted to be more than a 'low-tier' curiosity. I wanted to belong here, in the dark.

"I won't fail," I said, trying to find a steel in my voice that I didn't quite feel.

Crakoukass didn't reply. He simply turned and vanished into the darkness as if he had never been there at all.

I stood there for a moment, the silence of the Hall pressing in on me, until a soft, rhythmic sound reached my ears. A slow, deliberate clap.

"Bravo," a voice drawled. "Truly, a performance for the ages. I especially liked the part where your joints announced your presence to the entire zip code."

I turned. Lamz was leaning against a pillar at the far end of the hall, looking as if he’d been carved from the very night. He was a high-tier ghoul, his skin a smooth, preserved grey, his movements fluid and insulting. He was busy polishing a dagger made of obsidian so dark it seemed to drink the light.

"Go away, Lamz," I muttered, pulling my oversized hood lower.

"Oh, I'm going," he said, pushing off the pillar with effortless grace. He sauntered past me, the sharp edge of his shoulder glancing off my ribs. "But enjoy your last night in the Citadel, bone-heap. I’ll be sure to send a postcard to Glim when I'm in the Shadow-Guard. Assuming they even have a post office."

He laughed—a cold, oily sound—and disappeared toward the initiates' quarters. I stood alone in the Whispering Hall, my soul-flame burning a frantic, defiant blue.
