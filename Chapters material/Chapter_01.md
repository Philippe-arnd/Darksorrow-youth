# Chapter 1

*This file outlines Chapter 1 only — no prose.*

---

## Goal

Darksorrow fails a practice stealth run and faces a final warning from Master Crakoukass. He is mocked by Lamz.

## Scene Beats

1. Darksorrow is sneaking through the "Whispering Hall." He's doing well until his knee clicks.
2. Master Crakoukass, who was watching from above, lands silently in front of him.
3. Crakoukass gives him a choice: pass the first exam tomorrow or return to Glim to be a "bone-scavenger."
4. Lamz appears at the end of the hall, smugly polishing his obsidian daggers.

## Notes

- Focus on the sensory details: the cold stone, the silence of the hall, the sound of Darksorrow’s bones.
- Darksorrow's internal monologue should be self-deprecating but determined.
